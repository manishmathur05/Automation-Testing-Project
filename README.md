# Automation-Testing-Project
In this project I have used flipkart and freecrm website and used selenium,cucumber,java and mysql.

THE PROJECT

I navigated to flipkart website and searched for "ASUS" phones then I captured the details like phone name,rating,reviews and review count for all the phones and store then in my database.

Then I navigated to freecrm website and extracted each mobile and its details from my databse and created seprate companies for each one of them by filling details.

After listing all the mobiles I have performed multiple functions.

All this process was automated by using selenium and cucumber

I have also performed login credential testing and others.
